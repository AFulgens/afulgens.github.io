# About this site

## General

This is a personal blog, written by myself[^1].

Hosted via GitHub Pages[^2].

<div class="annotate" markdown>
Created with Material for MkDocs[^3] with the privacy plugin enabled (1), thus GDPR-compliant usage of Google Fonts and other “embedded” stuff like scripts, etc. should™ be guaranteed™.
</div>
1. This should really respect your privacy with some caveats, see [the documentation of the plugin](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/privacy/). Essentially everything (like Google Fonts, external scripts, etc.) should be pre-fetched during the building of this site and should be served of off the GitHub servers directly. Thus, the only guy knowing anything™ about you should be GitHub, and SimpleAnalytics (see next point).

GDPR-compliant no-cookie tracking with SimpleAnalytics[^4]. Wait what... no cookies? Yep, this site does not use cookies.

## Code examples

Code examples—unless otherwise noted—are written by me, are under a general MIT license[^5] and absolutely without any warranty of any kind—without even a warranty that they are a meaningful example within the writing itself.

## Why do you have a “Beta” in your name?

<div class="annotate" markdown>
That's not a β (1), as in the βlog's name, instead it is an ß (2).

This is a joke, because my name contains an á (3), which is rendered as ß when underdoing Windows-1250 (CP 1250) → MS-DOS Latin 2 (CP 852) [Mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake). Up to this day, I receive parcels adressed to Dßniel Kovßcs.

Additionally, a former version of MkDocs (or rather probably some dependency of it) rendered á as à (4) on Windows, thus, in the source of this page à and á were reversed. Which was extra funny.
