# Operation: Runway strip

Learning something new has always been fun for me.

<!-- more -->

I am learning this new hobby and I plan to use this blog really as a blog... a web log[^1].
Alas, also as a dictionary for the “future me.”
Thus, I will be documenting everything I can think of that I am learning.

The first such thing is how to get rid of paint on miniatures.
This is important for multiple reasons, and I have two main ones:

- I am a beginner. I will have miniatures that I’ll want to re-do.
- My very first project—painting the commander miniatures of Risk 2210 A.D.—is using pre-shaded miniatures. I want to start afresh.

After a very thorough 5 minutes of using DuckDuckGo, I ended up reading a tutorial about just how to do that[^2].

<figure markdown="span">
    ![](../../../../images/240420-operation-runway/preparing-for-bath.jpg){ width="400" }
    <figcaption>Commanders preparing for a bath</figcaption>
</figure>

So, armed with isopropyl alcohol[^3] I have soaked all 25 miniatures (5 of each of the 5 commanders) for around an hour and spent another 1½ scraping them off with a toothbrush.
I think it was worth it.

Just to be able to start from an "as clean as possible" state.
