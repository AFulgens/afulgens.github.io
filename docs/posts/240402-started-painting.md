# Starting a new hobby: Miniature painting

I was a child, once.
And I played a _lot_ of video games.

    <p style="text-align: right;">— Robert Jordan</p>_

Heroes of Might and Magic II[^1], III[^2], and IV[^3] were amongs them (so were The Settlers II[^4] and Theme Hospital[^5], but that’s besides the point).

Last year, there was a Kickstarter campaign for a HoMM3 Board Game[^6], where—if not for anything else, then for the nostalgia-factor—I did what I must: I have gone all-in.

And now here I am, taking up a new hobby of figure painting[^7].
Of course, because I don’t want to ruin the very valuable HoMM3 BG miniatures, I will have to start the hobby with other miniatures.

Hence... I already have at least three projects, with an optional stuffed into the middle for good measure, if I get the money to order the miniatures for it:

* Risk 2210 A.D. ([BGG Link](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1829/risk-2210-ad)) – paint the Commanders
* My Father’s Work ([BGG Link](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/328866/my-fathers-work)) – paint all the minis
* (Optional) Lost Cities ([BGG Link](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42487/lost-cities-the-board-game)) – create/order minis instead of the meeples[^8] and paint them
* and last(? hopefully not!) but not least the HoMM3BG ([BGG Link](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/355326/heroes-of-might-and-magic-iii-the-board-game))
