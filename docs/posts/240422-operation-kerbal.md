# Operation: Kerbal

What a mess.

    _F.A.I.L.: First attempt in learning._

## How hard can painting a mini be?

Of, my sweet summer child!

I have had the idea to start with the space commander, with the vague idea that I would like to have the wings in teal and the guns shiny.
No other idea.

Look at this clownfest:

<figure markdown="span" style="text-align: center; width: 87%;">
    ![](../../../../images/240422-operation-kerbal/space-kerbal-1.jpg){ width="43%" }
    ![](../../../../images/240422-operation-kerbal/space-kerbal-2.jpg){ width="43%" }
    <figcaption>Clown commander #1 front/back</figcaption>
</figure>

OK, I have realized pretty quickly that I will scrap these minis and start from scratch, so I decided to experiment randomly further. Et voilÃ :

<figure markdown="span" style="text-align: center; width: 87%;">
    ![](../../../../images/240422-operation-kerbal/space-kerbal-3.jpg){ width="43%" }
    ![](../../../../images/240422-operation-kerbal/space-kerbal-4.jpg){ width="43%" }
    <figcaption>Clown commander #2 front/back</figcaption>
</figure>

## What have I learned from this experience?

* Too many (primary or close) colors simply result in a clownfest.
* Without a proper idea for the color/theme/etc. do not start painting the mini.
* Clear ideas are a must.

Yep, just like starting out in [Kerbal Space Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerbal_Space_Program) (I guess... I have never actually played it ðŸ˜±).
